## Site Overview
The Clothing Boutique website is for potential customers to view the boutique's catalog and for managers and employees of the boutique to update the catalog depending on their role. The Boutique has existing functionality for the majority of project requirements. Some broken functionality is marked with todo and fix me comments, other broken functionality is not. The Boutique also has a list of expected enhancements. 

## Project Requirements
- Users are able to create an account
- Developer is able to assign a user the role of manager or employee
- Users who do not create an account can view all items available in the boutique but cannot view an item's details
- Any user, even without a role, can view all items available at the boutique and that item's detail page which gives the user the option to edit or delete an item
- Employees and managers are able to edit an item via form but only managers are able to delete an item
- Employees and managers can also create a new item via form but any other user cannot

## Current Users
- Email : user2@email.com Password : P@ssw0rd
- Email : manager1@email.com Password : P@ssw0rd
- Email : employee1@email.com Password : P@ssw0rd

## Enhancements
- Style item details to display in a grid across the page with more modern buttons to navigate to edit
- Style forms to appear more modern and update the labels from property names to more appropriate field names
- Provide unique validation message if item name is too long and display validation message in browser in red text with a red border around the invalid input
- If an item is featured add custom styling
- Add client side validation

## Additional Requirements
- Include a postman collection with requests for CRUD endpoints
- Add comments throughout the code
- Record bugs and enhancements as you move through the project using the repository's `Issues` board
- Preform all code changes on a new branch (or branches) and associate issues with pull requests 
- Push smaller file changes and push often in order to more accurately track your progress through the assignment and more appropriately associate code changes with closed issues
